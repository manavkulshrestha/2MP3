	This is a multiline comment like in C, Java, etc. Tabs are not necessary, but look nice.
*/
# Single line comments are also allowed, but are in python style so they don't mess with urls.


# Comments are removed once the file is read using simple regex replace.
# Don't try weird nested comment edge cases, thanks.

# But if you're having a legitimate issue due to the way tagging or commenting is interpretted, open an issue
